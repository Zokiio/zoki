  # My First Post

  Welcome to my blog! This is my very first post. I'm excited to start this journey and share my thoughts, experiences, and knowledge with you.

  ## Why I Started a Blog

  I'm am not very good at writing and expressing my thoughts, with this I hope to improve those points. Starting a blog seemed like a natural step to practice but also to document my journey and hopefully to connect with others who share similar interests.

  ## What to Expect

  In this blog, I plan to write about:

  - My experiences with web development, focusing on technologies like React, TypeScript, and Node.js.
  - Tips and tricks that I've learned in my career as a software developer.
  - Personal development and learning strategies for continuous growth in the tech industry.
  - And also my journey to becoming healthier and more productive.
  - And much more!

  ## Stay Connected

  I'm looking forward to growing with my readers and building a community. Feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joakimhall/) or follow me on [GitHub](https://github.com/Zokiio) to stay updated with my latest projects and posts.

  Thank you for reading, and stay tuned for more!
